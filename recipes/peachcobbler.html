    <h2>Description</h2>
    Peach Cobbler recipe! Make a sweet, tart dessert in a quick amount of time.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 29-ounce can peaches in juice, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>Dash of vanilla</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>Pinch of nutmeg</li>
        <li>Pinch of cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Place butter in a 9x13-inch baking dish and bake until the butter melts, about 5 minutes. 
        Remove the dish from the oven. Drain in the juices from the can of sliced peaches and stir.</li> 
        <li>Chop the drained peaches into smaller quarters, then add them to the baking dish. Sprinkle brown sugar over the peaches, then pour vanilla on top and stir to combine. </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt. Slowly whisk in buttermilk until a lumpy batter forms. Dollop the batter over the peaches, giving it a light swirl to marble the batter into the fruit mixture. </li>
        <li>Bake the peach cobbler for 35 minutes, turn it in the oven, and continue cooking until the crust is deep golden, about 10 minutes more. Let the dessert cool for 15 to 30 minutes. Then, serve it warm with a scoop of ice cream or dollop of whipped cream, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
