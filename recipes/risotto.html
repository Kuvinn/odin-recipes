    <h2>Description</h2>
    A delightful risotto with broccoli and chicken. Grate with cheese and chopped parsley for extra flavor!
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Broccoli</li>
        <li>Arborio rice</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Roast the broccoli for 12-15 minutes at 425Â°F.</li>
        <li>Warm the broth in a medium sized saucepan over medium heat and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken until is no longer pink, place chicken on a paper towel lined plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Sweat onions for ~5 minutes Add in the garlic, thyme and more salt and pepper to taste. Then add in the arborio.</li>
        <li>Add the broth slowly and in increments. Ladle about 1/3 cup of warm broth in at a time and never stop stirring. Once the liquid has been mostly absorbed, continue to ladle in more warm broth and regularly stir. After ~20-25 minutes, risotto should should be al dente with still a little bite to it. There should be a pleasant chew, on the soft side of al dente.</li>
        <li>Lastly, add in the shredded cheese, cubed chicken and roasted broccoli. Stir to combine.</li>
    </ol>
